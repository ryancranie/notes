## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity categories:
- Critical Infrastructure
- Application Security
- Network Security
- IoT Security
- Cloud Security
People and Processes protect these.

Information Security (InfoSec) is the practice of protecting information
- Preventing
- Detecting
- Remediating

InfoSec also involves documenting
- Processes
- Threats
- Systems
Information can be digital/physical

Information Systems Security is a subset of InfoSec
Information Systems Security is defined as protecting systems from
- Unauthorized access
- Modification
- Destruction
- Denial of Access

Information Systems include
- Devices
- Computer Networks
- Physical Systems

Subsets:
Information Security
- Information Systems Security
	- Cybersecurity

First Line of Defence and Precautions
- Educate employees
- Prepare for disaster and prepare for recovery
	- Backup data online

## Principles of Information Security

CIA Triad that defines the principles of Information Security
- **Confidentiality**
	- Data is kept confidential and private
- **Integrity**
	- Data is authentic, accurate, reliable and free from tampering
- **Availability**
	- Data is available to those who need it

The DAD Triad is the opposite of the CIA Triad
- **Disclosure**
	- Data is exposed to unauthorized parties
- **Alteration**
	- Data cannot be authenticated to be untampered with
- **Denial**
	- Data is inaccessible to authorized parties
A firewall an help neutralize the DAD Triad.

Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
A framework that controls resources, enforces policies and audits usage.
- **Authentication**
	- Process of identifying and verifying a person or thing
	- As an Identity and Access Management Tool (IAM), a AAA server compares a user's credentials with its database of stored credentials
- **Authorization**
	- Process of controlling access to resources
	- User is granted privileges to access certain areas of a network or system, permissions are stored in a database along with users identity
- **Accounting**
	- Record keeping and tracing of agent activities on computer devices and networks.
	- Logs: includes uniform resource identifier (URI) they use, their internet protocol (IP) address
