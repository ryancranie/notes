# Cryptography Overview

**Cryptography** is the study of writing or solving codes.

Public Key Infrastructure ([PKI](https://notes.ryancranie.com/Notes/Cryptography/PKI)) is the implementation of cryptology on a computer network; a PKI is an infrastructure composed of:
- hardware
- software
- policies and procedures
that facilitates the management of public digital keys.

**Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext to crypto text.
- keeps data private and confidential

A Digital Signature ties the signee to the information signed
- uses cryptography to produce a unique value
- integrity, authenticity and non repudiation.
	- **non-repudiation** means a user cannot deny (repudiate) having performed a transaction.

Cryptography has facilitated the rise of e-commerce and secure communications.
