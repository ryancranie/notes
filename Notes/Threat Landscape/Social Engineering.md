## Social Engineering Techniques

Examples of Social Engineering Goals:
- disclosing confidential information
- transferring money
- influencing a person/persons to think in a certain way.

Social engineering = emotional manipulation

How to spot a social engineering attack:
Look for an emotional plea that leverages
- fear
- curiosity
- excitement
- anger
- sadness
- guilt
- a sense of urgency
- an attempt to establish trust

Famous example:
**Frank Abagnale** impersonated
- doctor
- lawyer
- airplane pilot

Social Engineering Attacks
- **Smishing**
	- text messages
		- instant messages
		- live chat
		- SMS
		- text messaging
- **Vishing**
	- phone calls/voice messages
		- AI voice impersonation
- **Spear phishing**
	- ostensible emails (seemingly trusted sources)
	- **Whale phishing**
	- phishing big targets via email
- **Quid pro quo**
	- bad actor offers a service in return for information
		- usually tech support
- **Pretexting**
	- a situation devised to invoke an emotional response in the target
		- example: phone call that someone needs bail
- **Baiting**
	- an enticing situation that tempts you to act, positive emotions
		- you won a prize
		- USB stick left in open

Types of Social Engineering
- **Scareware**
	- Instilling fear through misinformation
- **Watering hole**
	- targeting a site that the target frequents.
- **Honeypot Trap**
	- Attracting the target with something enticing
- **Tailgating**
	- Exploiting social conventions to gain access to a physical facility or access-controlled room.

An attacker can use multi-attack methods for their approach to a situation, their methods of bad acting can evolve overtime.

**Java applets** are small applications written in Java programming langauge. They are used to provide interactive features to web applications and can be executed by browsers for many platforms. Because they are small, portable programs embedded in HTML pages can run automatically when the page is viewed, they are execellent vehicles of attack by bad actors.

**Reverse Shells**, also known as remote shells or connect-back shells, take advantage of the target system's vulnerabilities to initiate a shell session and then access the victim's computer. 

## Insider Threat

An insider threat is an individual or individuals who work for an organization or have authorized access to its networks or systems, and who pose a physical threat or cyberthreat to the organization.

An insider threat can be unintentional, by a **negligent** employee, or could be a **malicious** bad actor

Malicious Insiders
- aka turncloaks
- actions include:
	- Espionage
	- fraud
	- Intellectual property theft
	- Sabotage

Types of malicious insiders
- **Mole**
	- an outsider who has gained access to the network, poses as
		- vendor
		- partner
		- contractor
		- employee
- **Collaborator**
	- authorized users who work with a 3rd party (such as)
		- competitor
		- nation-state
		- organized criminal network
		- an individual
- **Lone Wolf**
	- works independently and without outside influence

Types of negligent insiders
- **Pawns**
	- manipulated by bad actor
		- tailgating
		- spear phishing
- **Goof**
	- deliberately careless but does not harbour malicious intent
		- arrogant
		- ignorant
		- incompetent

Physical Attack Vectors used against negligent insiders
- **tailgating / piggybacking**
	- going through a gate following an authorized user, unauthorized
- **shoulder surfing**
	- uses direct observation techniques, such as looking over a shoulder to see information
- **dumpster diving**
	- looks for information in someone else's rubbish/recycle bin, or it could be a printer room where confidential information is printed
- **eavesdropping**
	- listening in an a conversation
	- network snooping/sniffing
		- more common on wireless networks

How to detect a possible insider threat
1. dissatisfied with organization
2. holds a grudge against the organization
3. starts to take on more work with excessive enthusiasm
4. routine violations
5. open dislike to organizations policies
6. attempts to circumvent security

Anomalous activity to detect insider threat
- activity at unusual times
- large volume of traffic
- unnecessary traffic
- requests for access to irrelevant systems
- using unauthorized devices, such as USBs
- network crawling 
	- deliberate searchers for sensitive information
- emailing sensitive information outside the organization

Recommendations to not be an insider:
- Learn organization's policies
- Do not share proprietary information
- Secure all confidential data
- Do not allow tailgating
- Do not expose login credentials
- Patch your devices
- Do not disable endpoint security and controls
- No shortcuts of security policies

Network actions to protect assets
1. Identify critical assets
	- logical
	- physical
2. Rank and prioritize each asset and asses their security
	- Machine Learning (**ML**) can help analyse the data stream and prioritize the most relevant alerts
	- user and event behaviour analytics (**UEBA**)
		- establishes a baseline for normal data activity
3. Deploy honeypots for insiders

1. Define, document and disseminate
2. Provide training
3. Promote a culture of security awareness

## Fraud, Scams and Influence Campaigns

**Cyber Fraud** is a social engineering technique, [malware](https://notes.ryancranie.com/Notes/Threat%20Landscape/Malware), and other type of deception that is used to defraud or take advantage of a person or organization for financial or personal gain

**Cyber Scams** are a type of fraud, but they are generally classified as petty, or not as serious as cyber fraud

- Copycat government websites
- Dating and romance scams
- Holiday fraud
- Mandate fraud
	- hacks an email transaction, replaces legitimate banking info with their own
- Pharming
	- bad actors redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a fake one, such as e-commerce or banking site.
- Greeting card scams

**Influence campaigns** are large scale efforts to shift public opinion. Such campaigns are generally executed in bad faith and seek to promote a false narrative. These campaigns are often carried out by groups with high levels of capability, up to and including nation-state actors.

Online influence campaigns
1. Create fake user accounts
2. Create content
3. Post content
4. Real people see and share content
5. Mass media amplifies message
^if openly said on non-fake account, legal recourse can be taken.

Influence campaign's can also be a part of hybrid warfare.
Cyber warfare can include
- hacking
- social engineering
- influence campaigns
- promoting fake news
