Software-Defined Wide Area Network (**SD-WAN**)
- leverages corporate WAN
- multi-cloud connectivity
delivers high speed a\application performance

## Before SD-WAN
In the past organizations used to purchase their own servers to
- run applications
- store critical data
This led to issues such as 
- paying highly trained technicians
- upfront capital expense
- making these servers avaliable to various geographically-distributed networks, called local area networks
	- aka Local Area Networks (**LANs**)
Whilst it was expensive, the competitive advantage it gave over those who didn't computerize their business made it worthwhile.

A Wide Area Network (**WAN**) is a computer network that spans a large geographical area
- typically consists of 2 or more LANs

Traditionally, businesses connected their LANs by way of a single, dedicated service provider.
- they could control and secure this connection while providing access to critical resources
Disadvantages include
- expensive
- single point of connection was subject to frequent outages, which made it unreliable.
- higher latency
	- because of demand to host applications in the cloud
		- known as Software as a Service (**SaaS**)
	- greater reliance on voice and video conferencing.

## SD-WAN First Generation
Businesses began to augment their connectivity by employing multiple providers, or seeking more affordable means of internet connectivity. The trend towards hybrid connections, and the growth of cloud applications, led to the first generation of SD-WAN.

The first generation of SD-WAN solved a pressing business need: its basic load-balancing allowed the network to make application intelligent business decisions on hybrid WAN links, including
- service provider
- broadband
- long-term evolution (**LTE**)
	- a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals

## Benefits of SD-WAN
- accurate application identification
- visibility into network performance
- reliable switchover of application traffic between WAN links
- reduced cost (compared to sending data to multiple data centers)
- ease of management
- lower latency

Should a particular link degrade, the SD-WAN device knew to move the connection to the better performing WAN link.

SD-WAN's nowadays have a centralized management console.
- simplification
- consolidation
- cost reduction

SD-WAN enhances:
- the enterprise
- Software as a Service (**SaaS**)
- Unified Communications as a Service (**UCaaS**)
